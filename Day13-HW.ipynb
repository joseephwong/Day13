    "**Q1: The graph has an x-axis that represents the date. However, it is not ordered chronologically, but instead jumps forward and backwards in time. This makes it appear that there is a continuous decrease in the number of deaths and hospitalizations. The actual data suggests there was an increase until 28 April 2020, where it peaked then started to decline. Then, it appears to increase and peak again around 07 May 2020, followed by another decline.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Misrepresenting data is an ethical dilemma because the data scientist may believe they are doing the right thing by manipulating the results. However, \"the right thing\" is subjective from individual to individual. It is not the responsibility of the data scientist to control others' opinions on a subject, but rather present the data in a truthful way where they can draw their own conclusions from it. Furthermore, providing a false hope is very misleading and can create mistrust in the data science community.**"

    "**Q3: A reasonable expectation of privacy is a gray area in data ethics as not everyone will have the same expecations of how their data can be used. To avoid crossing these boundaries, data scientists have to evaluate both the location and content of the data. If the data is locked, such as behind a paywall or only followers can view it, it should not be publicly released. If the data appears to be very personal, such as contact information or other intimate details, it should not be publicly released. Content can have more nuances because different people will find different pieces of information invasive. Personally, I would want most of my data to not be gathered. In the case it was, I would prefer that my name or other linking information not be included in the publication. Data on profiles may be public, but it is not posted with the expectation that it will be used to highlight the individual in an analysis.**\n",
    "**Q4: The content of data plays a large role in determining whether a data scientist should scrape it. In some contexts, such as statistics from sports or television shows, information is publicly released and attached to participants' names, which is widely available knowledge. So, it seems that scraping that data would be ethical. On the other hand, taking personal data from social media seems to be unethical. For example, LinkedIn profiles display a lot of private information, such as name, location, occupation, and connections. This data would be unethical to scrape as it would be highly identifiable and reveal much about an individual.**"

Although they both show the trend on their respective sides, they are not comparable.

    "**4. In my visualization, it is more clear that in counties with mask mandates, the average daily cases is decreasing over time. In counties without mask mandates, the average daily cases is remaining around the same. However, the daily average cases is greater in mask-mandated counties.

This suggests there is an association between having a masking mandate and reducing the number of COVID cases. This lines up with my previous knowledge of mask wearing, as I already belived masking reduced the number of COVID cases and the spread of COVID.**\n",

COVID would be more likely to spread in counties where residential buildings are closer together and humans have more interactions with one another. Meanwhile, counties with their population more spread out can distance from one another and lessen the risk of spreading COVID. Also, the fact that counties with mask mandates have a higher average of cases brings up the possibility of these counties enforcing mask mandates *because* they have high number of cases. However, we would need to have access to data regarding when the mask mandates were put in place.**"
